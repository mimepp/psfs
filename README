psfs is a filesystem (based on FUSE) for accessing
remote disk through piping server.
The access is based on http request, so it could
go through NAT.
=====================================================
(You can use it in commercial software, but please let me know.)
This application is dedicated to my lovely son (Hean Yu).

What's piping server?
Infinitely transfer between every device over HTTP/HTTPS:

How to build psfs from source code?
=====================================================
o download:
  git clone https://github.com/mimepp/psfs.git

o prepare before configure
  please install depends, on ubuntu e.g.:
  sudo apt-get install gtk-doc-tools libfuse-dev libjson-c-dev libcurl4-nss-dev

  - json-c will be used to load/save psfs.conf and psfs_oauth.json
  - glib will be used for hash table

o configure:
  cd psfs
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  (run ./configure --help for more options)

o build:
  make

o install (need root)
  make install

o prepare before run
  please edit psfs.conf as you wish, e.g.:
{
        "piping_server_link_prefix": "https://ppng.io",
        "piping_server_link_path": "xxxx",
        "mount_point": "/tmp/psfs",
        "log_path": "/tmp"
}
  "piping_server_link_prefix" is the http link of piping server
  "piping_server_link_path" is communication path for piping server
  "mount_point" is the mount point which you want mount psfs to
  "log_path" is the path which will be used in debug mode.

o run:
  mkdir /tmp/psfs
  cd src/
  ./psfs -c ../psfs.conf
